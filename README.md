# YolDost - Cursor x ALT+TAB Hackathon

YolDost (formerly OmniSight) compares live Google walking alternatives using
explainable physical street indicators. The product idea is **"en
kalabalik/aktif, daha guvenli rota potansiyeli"**: helping a person choose a
route with stronger activity/comfort signals such as green areas, cleanliness,
sidewalk quality, lighting, physical openness, main-street proximity,
POI/open-business activity, and authorized city data.

YolDost does not predict crime or guarantee safety. It never counts people,
profiles individuals, reads plates, or tracks people/vehicles. The product
promise is limited to activity and physical-environment potential:

## Mandatory Stack

| Layer | Technology | Deploy target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Web application | Next.js App Router, TypeScript | Vercel |
| Mobile application | Expo, TypeScript | Expo Go / EAS |
| Core backend | Go using [masterfabric-go](https://github.com/gurkanfikretgunak/masterfabric-go) architecture | Render.com |
| Database | Postgres through `DATABASE_URL` | Render Postgres |
| Live walking routes | Google Routes API, `WALK` | Render Go API |
| CV models and datasets | Hugging Face | local / Modal |
| Training compute | Modal, anonymized data only | Modal |
| Product AI assistant | Cursor SDK, server-side | Vercel |

Render.com, not Railway, is the required backend target in the hackathon
brief.

## Live Product Flow

1. Next.js sends origin, destination, and preference to the Render Go API.
2. Go requests live walking alternatives from Google Routes API.
3. Go returns distance, duration, polyline, attribution, and analysis coverage.
4. YolDost re-ranks only routes with sufficient physical-analysis coverage.
5. When coverage is missing, scores remain `null`; the system never invents a
   recommendation.
6. The optional Cursor SDK Route Assistant explains the returned metrics. It
   cannot calculate or change route scores.

```

## Local Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# fill secrets in .env, then sync client env files from the same Google key
bash scripts/sync-env.sh
bash scripts/check-env.sh
bash scripts/smoke-live.sh
```

Run each service in a separate terminal:

```bash
cd services/api && make run
cd apps/web && npm install && npm run dev
cd apps/mobile && npm install && npm run start
```

## Environment Variables

Real values stay in ignored `.env` / `.env.local` files. For the live
hackathon demo, web and mobile public API base URLs must point at the Render
Go service, not localhost.

| Name | Used by | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | Go API | live Google Routes requests and Maps-backed smoke tests |
| `GOOGLE_STREET_VIEW_API_KEY` | CV/data tooling | approved Street View access if used |
| `HF_TOKEN` | CV/training | Hugging Face datasets and models |
| `MODAL_TOKEN_ID`, `MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET` | training | private Modal jobs |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Go API | Render Postgres |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` | web | Render Go API URL |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` | mobile | Render Go API URL |
| `CURSOR_API_KEY` | Next.js server only | Cursor SDK Route Assistant |
| `CURSOR_MODEL` | Next.js server only | defaults to `composer-2` |
| `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `RENDER_API_KEY` | deployment | provider CLI/API access |

`CURSOR_API_KEY` must never use a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix. End users do not log
in to Cursor.

## Live Demo Deployment

| Surface | Live URL / config | Smoke test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Render Go API | [https://omnisight-api-70gd.onrender.com](https://omnisight-api-70gd.onrender.com) | [live](https://omnisight-api-70gd.onrender.com/health/live), [ready](https://omnisight-api-70gd.onrender.com/health/ready), `POST /api/v1/routes` |
| Vercel web | [https://web-lake-phi-31.vercel.app](https://web-lake-phi-31.vercel.app) with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://omnisight-api-70gd.onrender.com` | load the web URL and submit a walking route |
| Expo mobile | `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://omnisight-api-70gd.onrender.com` | open Expo Go/EAS build and confirm it shows the Render API target |
| Cursor SDK assistant | `CURSOR_API_KEY` on Vercel only | `POST /api/route-assistant` from the web UI |
| Hugging Face model (Modal v2) | [0xBatuhan4/yoldost-street-context-v2](https://huggingface.co/0xBatuhan4/yoldost-street-context-v2) | private repo; `classifier-head.pt` + `metrics.json` from run `20260606T125349Z-modal-scene` |
| Jury pitch deck | [https://web-lake-phi-31.vercel.app/pitch](https://web-lake-phi-31.vercel.app/pitch) — source `presentation/pitch-deck.html`, PDF `presentation/yoldost-deck.pdf` | open `/pitch`; arrows navigate, `F` fullscreen |

External smoke-test commands:

```bash
export RENDER_API_BASE_URL="https://omnisight-api-70gd.onrender.com"
export VERCEL_WEB_URL="https://web-lake-phi-31.vercel.app"

curl -fsS "$RENDER_API_BASE_URL/health/live"
curl -fsS "$RENDER_API_BASE_URL/health/ready"
curl -fsS "$RENDER_API_BASE_URL/api/v1/demo-runs"
curl -fsS -X POST "$RENDER_API_BASE_URL/api/v1/routes" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"origin":{"lat":41.0151,"lng":28.8689},"destination":{"lat":41.0192,"lng":28.8725},"preference":"balanced"}'
curl -fsS "$VERCEL_WEB_URL"
```

The local `http://localhost:8080` target is only for development or a clearly
labeled emergency fallback. The judging flow should show Vercel web and Expo
mobile calling the public Render Go API over the network.

## AI and Data

- Dataset: `Reubencf/streetview-global`, sourced from Mapillary under
  `CC-BY-SA-4.0`.
- Local privacy gate: face and plate regions are irreversibly masked before
  inference, training, upload, or display.
- Segmentation baseline:
  `nvidia/segformer-b0-finetuned-cityscapes-1024-1024`.
- Persisted classes are restricted to inanimate physical environment classes.
- Modal upload preflight: `python3 workers/cv/preflight_manifest.py` verifies
  `reports/data-manifest.json` against `data/interim/anonymized` before any
  training upload.
- Modal auxiliary training is labeled
  `street_activity_environment_context_auxiliary`. It uses only anonymized
  derivatives and weak `urban/suburban` context labels, then reports
  `weak_label_context_agreement` and `macro_f1_weak_label_context`.
  Modal is training compute, never the product API.
- Published fine-tuned head (private HF model):
  [`0xBatuhan4/yoldost-street-context-v2`](https://huggingface.co/0xBatuhan4/yoldost-street-context-v2)
  — run `20260606T125349Z-modal-scene`, 88.33% weak-label agreement, checkpoint
  SHA-256 `2da0121e5f6e929237e45da72a25f4e0f7be2a11cc352af326fac557730c2e10`,
  HF revision `bf949dc91777e367b65d59cf54ca4a67b971cc92`.
- The demo set has no pixel-level labels, so SegFormer mIoU is not claimed.
- Future route scoring may combine safe crowd/activity proxies
  (POI/open-business density, main-street proximity, transit/touristic activity,
  authorized aggregate city data) with environmental comfort signals
  (lighting cues, sidewalk/walkability, cleanliness/maintenance, openness,
  greenery, ordered public space). It must not use unauthorized camera person
  counting, identity/profiling, crime prediction, or safety guarantees.
- Cursor SDK explains structured route metrics only. There is no Gemini
  fallback and no mock AI response.

See [`docs/ai-usage.md`](docs/ai-usage.md),
[`docs/cursor-route-assistant.md`](docs/cursor-route-assistant.md), and
[`reports/training-summary.md`](reports/training-summary.md).

## KVKK Boundary

- No face recognition, plate OCR, person counting, demographic inference, or
  tracking.
- Raw imagery is never committed or uploaded to Vercel/Render/Modal.
- Public municipal/MOBESE viewer access is not processing authorization.
- Municipal camera imagery requires written permission and an official
  stream/API.
- Raw imagery is deleted at hackathon end and documented in
  [`docs/kvkk.md`](docs/kvkk.md).

## Verification

```bash
bash scripts/verify.sh
python3 workers/cv/preflight_manifest.py
```

Relevant direct checks:

```bash
cd services/api && go test ./... && go vet ./...
cd apps/web && npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run build
cd apps/mobile && npx tsc --noEmit
```

The integration evidence is recorded in
[`reports/integrations.md`](reports/integrations.md). The jury flow is in
[`docs/demo-plan.md`](docs/demo-plan.md).

## Known Limits

- Render Postgres is **not provisioned yet** and `DATABASE_URL` is **not set**
  on the live `omnisight-api` service. The postgres adapter is still a skeleton;
  production currently serves the deterministic fixture repository only.
  `/health/ready` reports `database: not_configured` explicitly.
- Current physical-analysis coverage is dataset/demo coverage, not city-wide
  coverage. Routes without matching coverage are explicitly unranked.
- Google route payloads are not persistently cached and require Google
  attribution.
- Revenue remains a hypothesis: premium preferences, route-neutral local
  sponsorships, and institutional mobility partnerships.
- Crowd/safety/offer concepts are product hypotheses only. In the MVP,
  "crowded/active" may be represented as POI/open-business activity,
  main-street proximity, public/open data, or authorized aggregated municipal
  density context; it is not CV person counting, user profiling, crime
  prediction, or a safety guarantee. Camera-based person counting is only a
  future legal/authorized aggregate-data gate, not current MVP behavior.
  Offers and sponsors must never alter route scores.
- `@cursor/sdk@1.0.16` currently brings unresolved high-severity transit
  dependency advisories. The endpoint is isolated and server-only, but this
  must be reassessed before production use.
