# Architecture

## Data flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    ROUTES[Google Routes API\nlive walking alternatives] --> API
    SV[Authorized / open-license\nstreet imagery] --> GATE
    subgraph worker [workers/cv — Python]
        GATE[1. Anonymization gate\nfaces + plates irreversibly masked] --> DET[2. Urban object detection\nanonymized derivative only]
    end
    DET -->|detection metadata +\nanonymization audit counts| API
    subgraph backend [services/api — Go on Render]
        API[REST API /api/v1] --> PG[(Render Postgres\nDATABASE_URL)]
        API -.dev/test.-> MEM[(fixture repository\ndeterministic demo data)]
    end
    API --> WEB[apps/web — Next.js on Vercel\nconsumer route comparison]
    API --> MOB[apps/mobile — Expo\nfield review shell]
    CONTRACTS[packages/contracts\nJSON Schema + TS types] -. shared shape .- API
    CONTRACTS -. shared shape .- WEB
    CONTRACTS -. shared shape .- worker
```

Order is a hard rule: **nothing downstream of the gate ever sees raw pixels.**
Raw imagery exists only on the local machine (`data/raw/`, gitignored) and is
deleted at hackathon end (`docs/kvkk.md`).

## Service boundaries

| Component | Owns | Does not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `workers/cv` | anonymization gate, object detection, result JSON | persistence, HTTP |
| `services/api` | live Google walking alternatives, REST endpoints, persistence, orchestration | UI, model inference |
| `apps/web` | consumer route selection, map, assistant UI, user-facing errors | raw data |
| `apps/mobile` | field-review shell | everything else (deliberately minimal) |
| `packages/contracts` | field names + invariants shared by all of the above | runtime code |

Storage holds **only anonymized derivatives and metadata** in normal
operation. Raw frames never reach the API, the database, or any deploy target.

## masterfabric-go mapping

The Go service mirrors the mandated
[masterfabric-go](https://github.com/gurkanfikretgunak/masterfabric-go)
architecture. Layer-by-layer correspondence:

| masterfabric-go | services/api | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cmd/server/main.go` | `cmd/server/main.go` | config → logger → deps → router → graceful shutdown, same run() shape |
| `internal/domain/<ctx>/model` | `internal/domain/inventory/model` | entities: DemoRun, ImageSource, Detection, AnonymizationEvent |
| `internal/domain/<ctx>/repository` | `internal/domain/inventory/repository` | persistence ports (interfaces) |
| `internal/application/<ctx>/dto` | `internal/application/inventory/dto` | API payloads |
| `internal/application/<ctx>/usecase` | `internal/application/inventory/usecase` | one use case per file, constructor injection |
| `internal/infrastructure/http/router` | `internal/gateway` (router) | chi + same middleware order (request id → logging → recoverer → CORS) |
| `internal/infrastructure/http/handler/<ctx>` | `internal/gateway/handlers` | thin handlers → use cases → shared/response |
| `internal/infrastructure/postgres/<ctx>` | `internal/infrastructure/postgres` | adapter skeleton + `migrations/0001_init.sql` |
| — | `internal/infrastructure/memory` | deterministic fixture repository for local development and backend tests; readiness exposes this source explicitly |
| `internal/shared/{config,logger,response,errors,middleware}` | same | ported nearly verbatim, trimmed to MVP scope |

Deliberately omitted at scaffold stage (MVP scope, AGENTS.md "do not
overbuild"): IAM/JWT auth, multi-tenancy, Kafka/event bus, Redis cache,
OpenTelemetry, the dynamic API-management gateway. New endpoints must follow
the existing pattern: model → repository port → use case → handler → route.

## Deployment topology

- **Vercel** builds `apps/web`; `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` points at Render.
  The optional server-side Cursor SDK Route Assistant also runs here and uses
  `CURSOR_API_KEY`; end users never authenticate with Cursor.
- **Render** runs `services/api` (`go build -o bin/server ./cmd/server`,
  health check `/health/live`) with an attached **Render Postgres**
  (`DATABASE_URL`).
- The CV worker runs locally (laptop) during the hackathon and posts results
  toward Postgres; **Modal** may be used for training/fine-tuning compute with
  anonymized data only — it is never the product backend.
- Final demo UI requires a reachable live API. If the API is unavailable, the
  web and mobile clients mark live data as unavailable instead of rendering
  embedded mock or fixture rows. The Go fixture repository remains only for
  local development/tests and is reported through `/health/ready`.
