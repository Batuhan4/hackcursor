## Overview

YolDost turns image-derived physical street indicators into route choices.
The interface must read like a real navigation product — Google Maps / Apple
Maps density — not like an operations dashboard and not like a marketing
site. Calm, quiet, map-first: the map is the primary surface, controls and
route cards sit on or beside it. No hero sections, no decorative gradients,
no ornamental motion. Mobile-first; equally professional at desktop widths.

All user-facing copy is Turkish. Claims are bounded by product policy:
"daha güvenli rota potansiyeli" / "çevresel göstergelere göre önerilen
rota" — never guaranteed safety.

> Status: v1 rebrand, adopted 2026-06-06. Supersedes DRAFT v0. Changing
> colors should only require editing the tokens above and the CSS custom
> properties that mirror them.

## Colors

Apple-style minimalist light theme. 70–80% of any screen is `surface`
(#F4F5F4 soft grey) and `panel` (#EAECE9 card background, with `border`
#DCE1DC as the light grey-green line); `raised` (#FFFFFF) is for inputs and
floating sheets. Interaction and key data use the accent pair: `brand`
(#2F9E67 active green — "Güvenli Rota Aktif" signals, icons, active page
indicators) and `ink` (#0B0F12 near-black — primary buttons like "Hemen
Başla" / "Devam Et" and headlines). `brand-strong` (#1B4332 dark forest
green) frames the safe-route card and gives depth; `brand-soft` (#E2EDE8
very light green) is the safe-route card background. `ink-dim` (#4A5560
soft fume) keeps secondary text from drowning the design in black.

Route lines get one color each: the recommended route uses `brand`, the
shortest route uses `route-shortest` (slate), a warm alternative uses
`route-warm` (ochre). Unselected routes render thinner and desaturated;
selection is shown by weight and color, never by glow.

Map demo canvas uses `map-canvas` with `map-road` streets and `map-park`
green zones — light, low-contrast, so route lines and markers carry the
contrast. `ok`/`warn`/`err` are reserved for status, not decoration.

## Typography

System stack (`system-ui`) only — no webfont cost, native feel on every
device. `display` is reserved for the YolDost wordmark, `title` for card
and panel headings, `body` for everything readable, `label` for chips,
badges and field labels. Numbers that get compared (durations, distances,
scores) use `metric` with tabular numerals so columns don't wobble.

## Layout

Mobile (≤768px): single column — compact brand bar, search card (origin,
destination, mode chips, primary button), map, then route cards. The first
viewport must already show brand, inputs, modes, the primary action, the map
and the top of the route list; keep vertical padding tight (`spacing.sm` /
`spacing.md`).

Desktop: navigation-app split — a fixed-width control rail (~400px) on the
left holding search, modes and route cards; the map fills all remaining
width as the main experience. Floating elements (assistant button, source
label) overlay the map with `spacing.lg` insets.

Never nest cards inside cards. One level of surface on top of `surface` —
that's it.

## Elevation & Depth

Essentially flat. Hierarchy comes from 1px `border` lines and background
steps (`surface` → `panel`). A single soft shadow
(`0 2px 8px rgba(20, 30, 24, 0.10)`) is allowed only for elements floating
over the map (assistant button, assistant panel, map labels). No stacked
shadows, no glassmorphism, no glow.

## Shapes

Radius is capped at 8px (`rounded.md`) for cards, inputs, buttons and the
map frame. `rounded.full` is reserved for small pill chips and badges (mode
chips, "Önerilen" badge, status pills) — never for cards or containers.
Route lines use round caps and joins.

## Components

- **button-primary** — the single strong action ("Rotaları Bul"). Full
  width on mobile. Hover darkens to `brand-strong`; visible focus ring
  (`2px` `brand` outline, offset 2px) for keyboard users.
- **route-card** — one route option: label badge, duration, distance,
  "+X dk" vs the shortest, indicator scores, and a one-sentence Turkish
  reason. Selected state: `brand` border (1.5px) + `brand-soft` left edge;
  unselected: `border`. Cards are buttons — keyboard focusable, Enter/Space
  selects.
- **mode-chip** — radio-group pills for route modes (Dengeli, Daha açık,
  Kaldırım dostu, Daha yeşil, Canlı cephe). Selected uses `brand-soft` +
  `brand-strong` text; exactly one selected at all times.
- **badge** — `badge-recommended` (brand) only on the recommended route;
  `badge-neutral` for "En kısa", "Daha yeşil" and similar tags.
- **assistant** — bottom-right floating "Rota Asistanı" button opening a
  single flat panel: message list, suggested questions as chips, text input
  + send. Demo answers are explicitly labeled "Demo açıklaması".
- **notes** — safety disclaimer and data-source labels render in `label` /
  small `body` with `ink-dim`: visible, never blocking.

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do**

- Keep the map the main experience; controls serve it.
- Use Turkish for every user-visible string; English for code identifiers.
- Show data provenance: "Hugging Face / Mapillary demo verisi", "Demo rota
  görselleştirmesi", "Demo açıklaması".
- Keep the safety note visible: route suggestions derive from physical
  environment indicators; real-world safety is never guaranteed.
- Use plain text/symbols (→, ↗, •) instead of adding icon packages.

**Don't**

- No purple gradients, decorative orbs, parallax or nonessential animation.
- No marketing hero blocks or oversized headlines.
- No nested cards, no radius above 8px on containers.
- No new icon/font dependencies (Lucide is not installed — keep it that way
  unless the team decides otherwise).
- No "kesin güvenli rota", "suçsuz rota", "garantili güvenlik" wording.
- No raw imagery, person counting, or municipal-data claims for open
  dataset samples.
